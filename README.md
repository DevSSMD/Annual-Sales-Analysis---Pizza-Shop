Address Revenue Dips:

Investigate reasons for January → February and July → August declines. Could be seasonality, lack of promotions, or staffing issues. Consider targeted campaigns during these months to stabilize revenue.

Leverage Peak Hours:

Focus marketing and staffing efforts on weekdays at noon, ensuring high demand is met efficiently.

Boost Evening Sales:

With 7 PM consistently being low, consider evening specials, discounts, or combo meals to attract customers during off-peak hours.

Menu Optimization:

Promote top-performing pizzas (Thai Chicken, Barbecue Chicken) more prominently in marketing and on digital platforms.

Evaluate Caree Pizza’s sales; either revamp the recipe, reposition it in promotions, or replace it with a new product to increase revenue.

Monitor Category Balance:

Since all pizza categories contribute evenly, maintain variety but explore highlighting popular categories during promotions to maximize revenue.
